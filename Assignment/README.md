# Assignment
The assignment was to implement a math function with a variety of functions using a provided prototype.
# Summary of Code
The calculator I designed utililies a switch function to perform the following functions
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  5. Modulo Division
  6. Shift Left
  7. Shift Right
  8. And (Bitwise)
  9. Or (Bitwise)
  10. Xor (Bitwise)
  11. Inverse (Bitwise)
# Functionality
The math function has three inputs: an integer "num1", an integer "num2", and a character "Operator". Num1 is the left operand, num2 is the right operand, and Operator determines the function performed using the two integers. When the Operator character is passed to the switch function, a mathematical function corresponding to the function is performed. For example:<br/>
`math(2, 5, '+')`<br/>
will add 2 and 5.<br/>
`2 + 5 = 7`
